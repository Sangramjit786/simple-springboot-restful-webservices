Developed a REST API web service project with a focus on implementing the DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern, utilizing both ModelMapper and MapStruct libraries for efficient and structured object mapping between domain models and DTOs. Implemented comprehensive exception handling, including both custom exception handlers and a global exception handler, to ensure consistent and centralized error management.

Incorporated validation of REST API requests, along with customized validation error responses to provide clear and structured feedback to clients. Additionally, integrated Spring Boot Actuator to enable and test production-ready features, such as health checks and monitoring endpoints.

For API documentation, used SpringDoc OpenAPI to generate interactive Swagger UI and customized the documentation using annotations to enhance clarity and usability for developers and API consumers.
